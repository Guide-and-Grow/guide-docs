## Overview

This guide covers the implementation and operations of different types of linked lists in JavaScript. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding and working with linked list data structures.

## Definition

A Linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called **nodes**, are not stored contiguously in memory.  Instead, each node contains **data** and a **references** , or link, to the next node in the sequence,

## Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

#### Core Operations

- **Push**: Add a new node at the end of the list
- **Pop**: Remove the last node from the list
- **Unshift**: Add a new node at the beginning of the list
- **Shift**: Remove the first node from the list
- **GetFirst**: Retrieve the first node
- **GetLast**: Retrieve the last node
- **Set**: Update the value of a node at a specific position
- **Insert**: Add a new node at a specific position
- **Size**: Get the total number of nodes
- **Clear**: Remove all nodes from the list

### 2. Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is an extension of the singly linked list where each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes.

#### Core Operations

- **Push**: Add a new node at the end of the list
- **Pop**: Remove the last node from the list
- **Unshift**: Add a new node at the beginning of the list
- **Shift**: Remove the first node from the list

### 3. Reverse Linked List

A specialized operation that reverses the order of nodes in a linked list.

## Implementation Notes

- Each operation maintains the integrity of the linked list structure
- Operations handle edge cases such as empty lists and single-node lists
- Memory management is handled appropriately for each operation

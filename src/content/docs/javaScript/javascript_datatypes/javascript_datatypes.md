# Datatype

A **datatype** is a classification that specifies the type of value a variable can hold in programming. It defines the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program, such as numbers, strings, or objects.

There are 8 datatypes in Javascript :

- **String :** Represents textual data in _single ('')_ and _double quote("")_.

```js
var name = "Alice";
```

- **Number :** Represents both _integer_ and _floating-point_ numbers.

```js
let num = 30;
```

- **Bigint :** Represents whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.

```js
let bigInt = 12345678901234567890n;
```

- **Boolean :** Represents a logical entity with two values: _true_ or _false_.

```js
let isStudent = true;
```

- **Undefined :** A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```js
let x;
```

- **Null :** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```js
let y = null;
```

- **Symbol :** Represents a _unique_ and _immutable primitive value_ used as the key of an object property.

```js
let sym = Symbol("id");
```

- **Object :** A _collection_ of properties and methods.

```js
var person = {
  firstName: "Yogita",
  lastName: "Shete",
};
```

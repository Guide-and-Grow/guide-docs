- JavaScript is a high-level language used to make websites dynamic. It runs in the user’s browser, allowing for interactive features like form checks and live updates. JavaScript works on both the client side and server side with tools like Node.js. It also has many frameworks and libraries, like React and Angular, to make development easier.

- JavaScript mainly runs in web browsers, which have built-in engines to interpret and execute the code. But JavaScript isn’t just for web browsers; it can also run in environments like Node.js. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on servers and outside the browser.

**Key Features of JavaScript:**

  - Dynamic Typing
  - Event-Driven Programming
  - First-Class Functions
  - Prototypal Inheritance
  - Asynchronous Programming
  - Rich Standard Library
  - Cross-Platform compatibility

**Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.

**Event-Driven Programming:** JavaScript supports event-driven programming, allowing developers to create responsive applications.

**First-Class Functions:** Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. 

**Prototypal Inheritance:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties directly from other objects.

**Asynchronous Programming:** JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing for non-blocking operations with features like `callbacks`, `promises`, and `async/await`.

**Rich Standard Library:** JavaScript provides a rich standard library, including built-in objects and functions for manipulating data, working with the DOM, and handling events.

**Cross-Platform:** JavaScript runs on multiple platforms, including web `browsers`, `servers`, and even `mobile devices`.

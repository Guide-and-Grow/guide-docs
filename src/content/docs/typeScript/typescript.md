title: What is TypeScript
description: discussion about typescript
---

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It extends JavaScript by adding static types, which helps catch errors during development and makes code more robust and maintainable. Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it allows developers to gradually adopt it by adding types to existing JavaScript code. This means you can still run all your JavaScript code within a TypeScript environment while benefiting from the added features and type safety that TypeScript provides.

## Why TypeScript

- Avoid Bugs in Development
- Type Safety
- Increase Development Speed
- Additional Features
- Better Code Completion
- Better Code Readability
- Better Code Documentation
- Better Code Performance

Node.js® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.  

Node.js is a tool that lets you run JavaScript on the server. It’s fast and efficient, using an event-driven, non-blocking model. Node.js is great for building web servers, APIs, and real-time apps. You can easily manage packages with npm. To use Node.js, install it, create a server file, and run your server with simple commands.

## Description
Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to create servers, web applications, command-line tools, and scripts. It allows JavaScript to run on the server, making it fast and efficient with its event-driven, non-blocking model. Node.js is ideal for building web servers, APIs, and real-time applications. Additionally, Node.js simplifies package management with npm.

## Key Features
- **JavaScript on the Server**: Run JavaScript code outside the browser.
- **Event-Driven**: Handles multiple connections efficiently.
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Improves performance by handling requests asynchronously.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Thousands of packages available via npm.
